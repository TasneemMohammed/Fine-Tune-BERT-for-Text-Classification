# Fine-Tune-BERT-for-Text-Classification
Fine Tune BERT for Text Classification with TensorFlow

## Steps
1:  Setup your TensorFlow and Colab Runtime

2: Load the Quora Insincere Questions Dataset

3: Create tf.data.Datasets for Training and Evaluation

4: Download a Pre-trained BERT Model from TensorFlow Hub

5: Tokenize and Preprocess Text for BERT

6:  Wrap a Python Function into a TensorFlow op for Eager Execution

7: Create a TensorFlow Input Pipeline with tf.data

8: Add a Classification Head to the BERT hub.KerasLayer

9: Fine-Tune BERT for Text Classification

10: Evaluate the BERT Text Classification Model
